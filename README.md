# `polatengin` man page

I was using `man` pages to learn more about `git rev-list` _(they really helped me understand how to use it)_.

Then I realized, as `polatengin`, I don't have a `man` page for myself 🤷‍♂️.

I asked myself, "Why not?"

> `man` pages are a great way to document tools and make them easier to understand.

So, I decided to create one for `polatengin`. My goal is to learn how to create and share a `man` page.

## `man` pages

`man` pages are the manual pages for commands in Unix-like operating systems. They provide detailed information about commands, their options, and usage.

## `man man` command

Let's start with the `man` command itself. You can use the `man` command to view the manual pages of other commands, including the `man` command itself.

```bash
man man
```

There is a section in the `man` page of the `man` command that explains the sections of the manual pages. Here is a summary of the sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Executable programs or shell commands |
| 2 | System calls (functions provided by the kernel) |
| 3 | Library calls (functions within program libraries) |
| 4 | Special files (usually found in /dev) |
| 5 | File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd |
| 6 | Games |
| 7 | Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7) |
| 8 | System administration commands (usually only for root) |
| 9 | Kernel routines [Non standard] |

For my `polatengin` `man` page, I will use section _7_, which is for _miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions)_.
