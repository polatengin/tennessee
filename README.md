# `polatengin` man pages

I was using `man` pages to learn more about `git rev-list` _(they really helped me understand how to use it)_.

Then I realized, as `polatengin`, I don't have a `man` page for myself 🤷‍♂️.

I asked myself, "Why not?"

> `man` pages are a great way to document tools and make them easier to understand.

So, I decided to create one for `polatengin`. My goal is to learn how to create and share a `man` page.

## `man` pages

`man` pages are the manual pages for commands in Unix-like operating systems. They provide detailed information about commands, their options, and usage.

## `man man` command

Let's start with the `man` command itself. You can use the `man` command to view the manual pages of other commands, including the `man` command itself.

```bash
man man
```
