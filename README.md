# `polatengin` man pages

I was using `man` pages to learn more about `git rev-list` _(they really helped me understand how to use it)_.

Then I realized, as `polatengin`, I don't have a `man` page for myself 🤷‍♂️.

I asked myself, "Why not?"

> `man` pages are a great way to document tools and make them easier to understand.

So, I decided to create one for `polatengin`. My goal is to learn how to create and share a `man` page.
